This project is one that I have been wanting to work on for a while but didn't really know how to start.

I previously built a Blockchain network that sends and recieves transaction data using the same algorithm as Bitcoin
<br/>SEE: https://github.com/amotor-AM/Full-Stack-Cryptocurrency<br/>
While this Blockchain network was neat and allowed me to learn a lot about Eliptic Curve Cryptogorphy and Blockchain Technology,
it's applications were limited strictly to transactional data.

This project will expand on those concepts and build out greater functionality by building an 'Ethereum Like' network. Such a network
is much more technically involved as it utilizes the Blockchain to store states of nodes on the network. In this way the network 
operates like a decentralized compute network powering a 'Decentralized Computer'.

Much like Ethereum, this network will include both a 'Cryptocurrency' and a Block Chain network. The blockchain network will have it's own 
'Programming Language' with operational support for Mathimatical Operations, loops, conditionality, and more. This 'language' will be used 
to power 'smart contracts'.

Since these smart contracts run code to change or mutate the state of the network their use case is almost infinite. For example;
a smart contract can be used to create complex financial systems(I.E. Decentralized Exchanges), enforce insurance policies, 
store data in online games, or even create power blockchain based ecommerce marketplaces. 

Unlike purely transactional based Blockchains (like Bitcoin), Our blockchain instead stores transactions of 'state'. This state is set as the
result of running our smart contracts. Since each transaction simply describes how the computer's state should change no 'Currency Units' are
required to change hands as a result of executing a smart contract.

Although the intention of this project is to mimic the way Ethereum operates by studying the documentation and utilizing similar data
structures and field names, it is in no way intended to be used as an alternative or substitution for the Ethereum network. Ethereum is 
far more complex than the scope of this project. The value of any tokens on this blockchain will be null.
