The blockchain for our project will act a lot like a traditional Blockchain network. Meaning that 
it will act a data structure for storing transactional data across the network. It will also be 
able to be destributed to different nodes on the network. 

The blockchain network will power the 'decentralized computer'. Each block in the blockchain will
contain data that will describe how the state of the 'decentralized computer' should change. As 
blocks are shared across the network the participants will then pick up on the changes and update
their state to match that of the network. Therefore the 'Global State' will remain intact.
